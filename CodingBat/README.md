# CodingBat

[CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/python) is a small coding practice site created by [Nick Parlante](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/nick/) featuring short, straight-to-the-point problems.

My solutions are currently in Python. By far, the questions seem easier, so the focus is mainly on writing clean code.
